# Store Management Systems

This is a simple project to understand OOP principles in python. 
Item -> Phone classes indicate Inheritance property. 
Keyboard class shows Polymorphism. eg, length of String and List
Decorators like @proprty, @name.setter shows Encapsulation. The attributes cannot be overriden directly. 
Abstraction means not showing the unneccesary methods/attributes to other classes.
